            <p>
                <strong>Salt and Light</strong> is a passionate and compassionate Christian mission
                organization, called to live as disciples of Christ Jesus — the salt and
                light of the world. Though based in the Philippines, our mission
                partners are spread across the globe. Our mission began in October
                2005, when Missionary Sungwon Lee began sponsoring a child he met
                among the railway settlers in **San Pedro City, Laguna**. This small act
                of obedience — made possible through the seed offering of a Korean
                girl — became a channel of Christ's compassionate love. From that
                humble beginning, many lives in underserved communities have been
                touched through child sponsorships, college scholarships, feeding
                programs, medical missions, and other ministries.

                In **November 2009**, at the request of beneficiaries and their families, we began a church
                ministry in the home of Pastor Sungwon and Ara. What started as a
                small gathering grew into a full congregation, moving from one
                location to another — always following God's leading. Today, Salt and
                Light carries out two main ministries — Community and Church — as
                channels of God's love and the gospel to all. We are disciples of
                Christ Jesus, called to make disciples. **Philippines for Christ! The
                World for Christ.**
