                <p>
                    <strong>Salt and Light</strong> s a God-centered, gospel-driven Christian mission organization
                    committed to glorifying God and serving people through the two Cs—Community and Church—as disciples
                    of Christ Jesus.
                    Rooted in the Reformed faith, we seek to live as the salt and light of the world—loving God, loving
                    others, and reflecting Christ in our daily lives. We are a family in Christ, growing together in
                    grace and walking together in faith.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ministry began in 2005, when Missionary Sungwon Lee started sponsoring a student he met among
                    the railway settlers in San Pedro, Laguna as part of a community outreach.
                    By the will of God, church ministry began in 2009 with volunteers and the families we served.
                    Through the grace of God, the ministry continues to grow—all for His glory.

            <h1 class="h1where">Where We're Going</h1>
            <p class="wherep">Our vision statement is simple: to know God and make him famous. Knowing God doesn't just
                mean knowing about God—it means having a real, intimate relationship with him. We desire to reach people
                across the Philippines and across the world with the good news of Jesus, helping them to encounter him
                in a real, authentic way. We're passionate about making God famous, and we believe we're called to plant
                churches in major cities across the Philippines, Asia, and the world—churches marked by passionate
                worship, inspired creativity, a hunger for God's presence, and the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
