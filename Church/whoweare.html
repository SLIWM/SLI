                    <strong>Salt and Light</strong> is a passionate and compassionate Christian mission
                    organization, called to live as disciples of Christ Jesus — the salt and
                    light of the world. Though based in the Philippines, our mission
                    partners are spread across the globe. Our mission began in October
                    2005, when Missionary Sungwon Lee began sponsoring a child he met
                    among the railway settlers in **San Pedro City, Laguna**. This small act
                    of obedience — made possible through the seed offering of a Korean
                    girl — became a channel of Christ's compassionate love. From that
                    humble beginning, many lives in underserved communities have been
                    touched through child sponsorships, college scholarships, feeding
                    programs, medical missions, and other ministries.

                    In **November 2009**, at the request of beneficiaries and their families, we began a church
                    ministry in the home of Pastor Sungwon and Ara. What started as a
                    small gathering grew into a full congregation, moving from one
                    location to another — always following God's leading. Today, Salt and
                    Light carries out two main ministries — Community and Church — as
                    channels of God's love and the gospel to all. We are disciples of
                    Christ Jesus, called to make disciples. **Philippines for Christ! The
                    World for Christ.**
