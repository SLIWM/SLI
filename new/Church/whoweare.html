      <div class="content">
          <p>Salt and Light is a passionate and compassionate Christian mission organization, called to live as disciples of Christ Jesus—the salt and light of the world.
            Though based in the Philippines, our mission partners are spread across the globe.
            
            Our mission began in October 2005, when Missionary Sungwon Lee began sponsoring a child he met among the railway settlers in San Pedro City, Laguna. This small act of obedience—made possible through the seed offering of a Korean girl—became a channel of Christ’s compassionate love. From that humble beginning, many lives in underserved communities have been touched through child sponsorships, college scholarships, feeding programs, medical missions, and other ministries.
            
            In November 2009, at the request of beneficiaries and their families, we began a church ministry in the home of Pastor Sungwon and Ara. What started as a small gathering grew into a full congregation, moving from one location to another—always following God’s leading.
            
            Today, Salt and Light carries out two main ministries—Community and Church—as channels of God’s love and the gospel to all.
            
            We are disciples of Christ Jesus, called to make disciples.
